## What Are Herbarium Specimens?

There are over 340,000 known flowering plant species, a lot to keep track of.  With many these species threatened by environmental change, it’s particularly important to document what is growing where.  This is one of the functions of herbarium specimens, preserved plants often in the form of pressed cuttings that have been collected since the 16th century.

## How Are Herbarium Specimens Made?

The technique used to preserve plants is very similar to that originally used.  A cutting is carefully spread out on absorbent paper, covered by another sheet, and pressed between boards so the plant doesn’t curl up as it dries. A specimen can then last indefinitely if kept from the three most common threats: water, fire, and insects.  Bulky items, like pine cones, are stored in boxes and items like fruits and orchid flowers are kept in jars filled with a liquid preservative.

## What Information Is on a Specimen Label?

A label with at least the plant’s name identifies the specimen.  Early labels usually contained little more than the name, often in Latin and a vernacular language.  As time went on, botanists realized that different species grew in different types of habitats so it was useful to record where the plant was found and also when it was collected and by whom.  Now it is standard to add geographic coordinates for precise location and also a short description of the habitat and other species present.

       label="Specimen of narrowleaf silkgrass (<em>Pityopsis graminifolia</em>) collected by John Nelson in Orangeburg, South Carolina. This illustrates the information that usually appears on specimens today: specimen name with its family underneath; the collector’s name; number, location, and date; a brief description of the plant and its habitat; geographic coordinates. The stamp of the A. C. Moore Herbarium and the accession number are in the upper righthand corner. The barcode at the bottom indicates that the specimen has been imaged and the label information digitized; the ruler and color chart at the top are references for quality control. The graphic description of the habitat is a specialty of the collector."
