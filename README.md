## What Are Herbarium Specimens?

There are over 340,000 known flowering plant species, a lot to keep track of.  With many these species threatened by environmental change, it’s particularly important to document what is growing where.  This is one of the functions of herbarium specimens, preserved plants often in the form of pressed cuttings that have been collected since the 16th century.

## How Are Herbarium Specimens Made?

The technique used to preserve plants is very similar to that originally used.  A cutting is carefully spread out on absorbent paper, covered by another sheet, and pressed between boards so the plant doesn’t curl up as it dries. A specimen can then last indefinitely if kept from the three most common threats: water, fire, and insects.  Bulky items, like pine cones, are stored in boxes and items like fruits and orchid flowers are kept in jars filled with a liquid preservative.

## What Information Is on a Specimen Label?

A label with at least the plant’s name identifies the specimen.  Early labels usually contained little more than the name, often in Latin and a vernacular language.  As time went on, botanists realized that different species grew in different types of habitats so it was useful to record where the plant was found and also when it was collected and by whom.  Now it is standard to add geographic coordinates for precise location and also a short description of the habitat and other species present.

This illustrates the information that usually appears on specimens today: specimen name with its family underneath; the collector’s name; number, location, and date; a brief description of the plant and its habitat; geographic coordinates. The stamp of the A. C. Moore Herbarium and the accession number are in the upper righthand corner. The barcode at the bottom indicates that the specimen has been imaged and the label information digitized; the ruler and color chart at the top are references for quality control. The graphic description of the habitat is a specialty of the collector."

## How Are Specimens Stored?

The practice of making specimens may have begun with people slipping cuttings between pages of a book, as a remembrance either romantic or scientific.  So it’s not surprising that many early herbaria were in book form.  Some collectors kept the specimens loose, others pasted or sewed them to sheets.  However, not everyone bound their specimens.  Leaving the sheets unbound made it easier to sort them, keep similar species together, and refile them as classifications changed.  Now, most herbaria store their specimens in folders for each species or genus, laid flat in metal cabinets; some put the folders in boxes.

## How Do Specimens Get Around?

Most herbaria have a diversity of specimens from many collectors, and specimens can end up in surprising places.  Botanists have always traded specimens to obtain ones of species they want to see for ones they have in multiples.  For example, British botanists were interested in North American species, while United States botanists craved seeing European plants, so exchanges were sought after.  Some collections made on Latin American expeditions were sold to collectors in Britain and France, others were plundered by the likes of Napoleon when he invaded Spain.  Today, it’s common for private collectors to donate their specimens to herbaria, and for herbaria to “pay” for determination of a species by giving an expert a duplicate.  It is such mobility that makes opening an herbarium cabinet exciting.
