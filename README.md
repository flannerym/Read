## What Are Herbarium Specimens?

There are over 340,000 known flowering plant species, a lot to keep track of.  With many these species threatened by environmental change, it’s particularly important to document what is growing where.  This is one of the functions of herbarium specimens, <span data-click-image-zoomto="-485,0,2427,1649">preserved plants</span> often in the form of pressed cuttings that have been collected since the 16th century.

## How Are Herbarium Specimens Made?

The technique now used to preserve plants is very similar to that originally used.  A cutting is carefully spread out on <span data-click-image-zoomto="1">absorbent paper</span>, covered by another sheet, and <span data-click-image-zoomto="2">pressed between boards</span> so the plant doesn't curl up as it dries.  A specimen can then last indefinitely if kept from the three most common threats: water, fire, and insects.

## What Information Is on a Specimen Label?

A label with at least the plant’s name identifies the specimen.  <span data-click-image-zoomto="1">Early labels</span> usually contained little more than <span data-click-image-zoomto="1|165,123,1251,974">the name</span>, often in Latin and a vernacular language.  As time went on, botanists realized that different species grew in different types of habitats so it was useful to record where the plant was found and also when it was collected and by whom.  Now it is <span data-click-image-zoomto="2">standard</span> to add geographic coordinates for <span data-click-image-zoomto="2|312,1616,1556,1185">precise location and also a short description</span> of the habitat and other species present.

The stamp of the A. C. Moore Herbarium and the accession number are in the upper righthand corner. The barcode at the bottom indicates that the specimen has been imaged and the label information digitized; the ruler and color chart at the top are references for quality control.

## How Are Specimens Stored?

The practice of making specimens may have begun with people slipping cuttings between pages of a book, as a remembrance either romantic or scientific.  So it’s not surprising that many early herbaria were in <span data-click-image-zoomto="1">book</span> form.  Some collectors kept the specimens loose, others pasted or sewed them to sheets.  However, not everyone bound their specimens.  Leaving the sheets unbound made it easier to sort them, keep similar species together, and refile them as classifications changed.  Now, most herbaria store their specimens in <span data-click-image-zoomto="2">folders</span> for each species or genus, laid flat in metal cabinets; some put the folders in boxes.  Bulky items, like pine cones, are stored in <span data-click-image-zoomto="3">boxes</span> and items like fruits and orchid flowers are kept in jars filled with a liquid preservative.

## How Do Specimens Get Around?

Most herbaria have a diversity of specimens from many collectors, and specimens can end up in surprising places.  Botanists have always <span data-click-image-zoomto="1">traded specimens</span> to obtain ones of species they want to see for ones they have in multiples.  For example, British botanists were interested in <span data-click-image-zoomto="2">North American species</span>, while United States botanists craved seeing European plants, so exchanges were sought after.  Some collections made on Latin American expeditions were sold to collectors in Britain and France, others were plundered by the likes of Napoleon when he invaded Spain.  Today, it’s common for private collectors to donate their specimens to herbaria, and for herbaria to “pay” for determination of a species by giving an expert a duplicate.  It is such mobility that makes opening an herbarium cabinet exciting.

## How Are Specimens Used by Botanists?

Herbaria have always been used for reference, as a reminder of a plant’s characteristics, and to teach students.  Botanists rely on specimens to compare traits among related species.  By the 18th century, when the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus developed his classification and naming system, herbaria had become essential tools because they provided evidence from the plant itself.  In the 19th century, the practice developed of considering the specimen studied by the person who originally described the species to be particularly important.  This became known as a type specimen.  Besides work in classification or taxonomy, specimens are used in systematics, that is, working out how species are related to each other. 


<param ve-image fit

Charles Darwin posited that all living things arose from a single organism and through descent with modification the number of species increased and organisms evolved different traits, driving the process still further.  In the 21st century it has become possible to extract DNA from specimens and use it in comparing species, making preserved plants powerful tools in evolutionary research and in studying genetic differences among populations of a single species.  In addition, chemists can analyze specimens for substances with medicinal effects, for plant chemicals produced during insect infestation, and for heavy metal pollutants.  As biodiversity is threatened by global warming and habitat destruction, specimen data is crucial in tracking climate change, spread of invasive species, and degradation of habitats.  Herbaria also house specimens of species now extinct in the wild and specimens that are identified as new species even decades or centuries after they were collected.

## How Are Specimens Used by Historians?

Herbaria can be the focus of an historian’s research or one source of information among many.  Botanists paid little attention to early herbaria because these only contained old plant names that were no longer valid.  Now collections are being reexamined, and historians are finding them valuable records of the movement of plants, such as the arrival of tomato specimens and seeds into Europe from Latin America and Middle Eastern specimens brought back by the Dutch botanist Leonhard Rauwolf.  These include varieties of cultivated plants that long ago disappeared.

<param ve-image fit

{#paragraph8}

Other historians use herbaria as one of many sources of information on topics ranging from documenting the travels of plant collectors to indigenous knowledge about plants and its exploitation by colonizers.  While specimen labels, particularly old ones, often contain just brief bits of information, these can be helpful in substantiating other information about a collector.  A specimen collected by Meriwether Lewis on his expedition with William Clark might give a general locale for collection and perhaps a date, but their journals can give more information about where they were and when.  The British plant collector Richard Spruce took notes on the indigenous uses for the plants he collected and in some cases these are still affixed to specimens.

## How Are Specimens Used by Artists?

From the early days of herbaria, specimens have been used as reference material by artists.  In illustrations where plants appear flattened, it might be because the artist was looking at a specimen rather than a living plant.  However, some artists were very adept at creating lifelike images from specimens, as in the case of the cobra plant <em>Darlingtonia californica</em>, where only a specimen was available.  

<param ve-image fit

{#paragraph 10}

Today, a number of artists are looking to herbaria for inspiration for their work.  The British artist Tracey Bush created “specimens” by making flower cutouts from cardboard packaging, to illustrate her argument that many people today are more likely to recognize brands by name than flowers by name.  In another statement on contemporary culture, the Colombian artist Alberto Baraya has “pressed” artificial flowers onto herbarium sheets and labeled with the location he collected them, often from far-flung hotels as a statement about the “invasiveness” of our manufactured world.

## Why Are Herbarium Specimens So Fascinating?

Herbaria are full of surprises.  While most sheets are white with plants and labels attached to them, sometimes a folder contains something very different like a specimen created by a British physician who obviously spent a great deal of time studying this grass, drawing details of it, and even making nature prints of its seeds.  Then he crafted a fitting presentation for all his work.  There are also herbaria made by people hardly considered scientists like the poet Emily Dickinson who created a book of specimens and the painter Paul Klee who attached his plants to brown paper and took his collection with him when he traveled.  Sometimes an insect will be found pressed along with the plant; one entomologist suggested that herbaria were good places to hunt for new beetle species.  There’s even a specimen of a pitcher plant with the remains of a frog that fell down its long vase-like leaf into digesting fluid and couldn’t escape.
